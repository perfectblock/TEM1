Please use omnet++ to run this simulation. 

These parameters can be changed through NED file: 
- Network Size
- Network Bandwidth 
- Number of connections 
- Link delay
- Average number of connections

These parameters can be changed through C++ source code: 
- Block size 
- Block processing time 
- Block size 
- Size of inv and getdata messages 

For very big networks it takes several hours to complete the simulation and several hours for generating the report.
